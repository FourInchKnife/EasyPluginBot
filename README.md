# Discord-Silencer-Bot
Silences anyone who doesn't use * before and after their messages. Doesn't silence people who have the "The Silent Few" role. Please don't add this to your Discord server. If you do, be warned. Many, many people will be silenced. There is no warning for being silenced. If you don't use * before and after your message, then you will lose the game.

This only silences people in the #silent-conversation channel.

tsb!perms returns the bot's permissions.
tsb!help gives the link to the top.gg page.
