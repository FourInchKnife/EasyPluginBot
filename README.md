# EasyPluginBot
Super easy implementation of discord.py commands extension.

**To use**

Put all of your code in one or more `cog` classes in a `.py`
file in `extensions/`. Make sure to define a variable called
`cogs` inside that file that holds a list of all of the `cog`
classes. To configure the bot, edit the files in `core/config.json`,
`core/keys.json`, and `core/core-extensions`.
