# Discord-Silencer-Bot
Bans anyone who doesn't use * before and after their messages. Doesn't ban people who have the "The Silent Few" role. Please don't add this to your discord server. If you do, be warned. Many, many people will be banned. There is no warning for bans. If you don't use * before and after your message, then you will disappear.
If for some strange reason you want to see this bot in action, go to my test Discord server at https://discord.gg/wzEAZ39
If I were you, though, I'd save myself the trouble.

Disclaimer: if this breaks your server it's not my fault.
